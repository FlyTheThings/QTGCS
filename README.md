# QTGCS

My previous repository pyGCS was temporarily paused for technical difficulties. It may crash or get stuck when control a quadcopter fly, which is very dangerous in real flight. There might be a lot of bugs in the scripts. I will try to figure it out in the future when I get time.

This repository QTGCS is written with C++ and QT. Currently it is quite stable and fast compared to pyGCS. It is still under construction and I will continue focusing on this repository and try to finish it.
